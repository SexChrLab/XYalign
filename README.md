# Inferring sex chromosome and autosomal ploidy in NGS data


### Publication  Links
- chromosome X: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2665286/
- chromosome Y: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6942/full/nature01722.html
- Repetitive mapping solutions: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22124482


### List of Goals:
1. Assess proportion of X-Y mis-alignment (and try to correct for this)

2. Identify sex chromosome ploidy from WGS data. 
  + XX - Female
  + XY - Male
  + XXY - Kleinfelter's
  + X0 - Turner's
  + And all other combinations
  
3. Identify copy number variations on X and Y
Because I think we have to address this if we want to get a really good handle on #2 given the extremely high copy number variable regions on X and Y - the ampliconic regions. Likely we will masking them out to infer #2, which will be easiest, but then we can have an extended goal to see characterize variations in these regions.



### Known problems and complications
- High sequence identity between X and Y
- Higher amount of sequence repeats
