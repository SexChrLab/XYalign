# CHANGELOG

# List in reverse chronological order
# Only listing changes since previous version/release

Version 1.1.0
	* Added --include_fixed flag to allow plotting of read balances < 0.05 and == 1.0 if desired
	* --xx_ref_out and --xy_ref_out now allow placement of output anywhere, while --xx_ref_out_name and --xy_ref_out_name allow choice of name of output, but files will be placed in XYalign output directory structure
	* Output pdfs (settings optimized for importing into Adobe Illustrator) of figures instead of png and svg files
	* Fixed some bugs in VCF parsing
	* Added plot_count_stats, plot_window_differences, and explore_thresholds to aid in working with XYalign output
	* Added --bwa_index flag to optionally create BWA indices in PREPARE_REFERENCE
	* Changed to relative imports from within xyalign

Version 1.0.0
	* Added --use_counts to use read count data in CHROM_STATS
	* Added --coordinate_scale to alter x axis labels for chromosome-wide plotting
	* Fixed recent bug introduced by updates to samtools which did not output all reads when stripping reads from a subset of data
	* Cleanup is default, but can be turned off with the flag --no_cleanup
	* Fixed bug in inference of Y chromosome presence/absence
	* Removed bwa indexing from ref_prep()
	* Added CHROM_STATS module to calculate coarse, scaffold-wide stats for a list of bam files (allowing for quick comparison)
	* bam.analyze_bam_fetch() now called bam.analyze_bam()
	* Option to ignore duplicates in bam analyses
	* bam.analyze_bam_fetch() now outputs pandas dataframe - calls to its output and utils.plot_depth_mapq() updated accordingly
	* Added plotting of window based variant measures (read balance and variant counts)
	* Added option to "homogenize" read balance values by subtracting all values less than 0.5 from 1 (e.g., 0.25 and 0.75 would be equivalent)
	* Added variants.read_balance_per_window, which calculates mean read balance (and variant count) per window
	* fixed bug in utils.make_region_lists_chromosome_filters()
	* depth filters for window filtering now simple multipliers of mean depth
	* plot_variants_per_chrom now a method of variants.VCFFile()
	* platypus_caller now a method of bam.BamFile()
	* Added filters for genotype quality and sample depth for variants
	* Fixed error in bam.strip_reads() that would return blank fastqs when sorting single end reads
	* assemble.bwa_mem_mapping_sambamba() now handles mapping without read group line
	* bam.strip_reads() now handles case where no read group is present in file
	* Added cleanup option for strip reads (allowing one to delete large temporary, unsorted fastqs)
	* Removed requirement for valid bam file for PREPARE_REFERENCE module
	* Fixed bug causing the misreading of bam indices ending in .bai, rather than .bam.bai
	* chromosome_bed() and check_chrom_in_bam() now methods of bam.BamFile()
	* Compress output fastq files (optional)
	* Add -xmx flag for repair.sh (was having issues estimating/allocating memory when sorting reads from whole genome)
	* Output histograms of depth and mapq for each chromosome
	* Output full dataframes from bam analyses in addition to high/low bed files
	* Removed flags --high_quality_bed_out and --low_quality_bed_out (unused)
	* Fixed bug in which postprocessing bed files were overwriting preprocessing ones (with the same name)
	* Added STRIP_READS module to allow for read stripping outside of REMAPPING
	* Added option for --chromosomes ALL, to easily analyze all chromosomes
	* Added check to ensure provided chromosomes are in bam file
	* Fixed bug in threshold for calling individual as XY
	* Generalized COMPARE_SEX_CHROMS so X-Y pairwise comparisons not necessary
	* Added support for reference genomes with only a single sex chromosome sequenced (e.g., in XY systems, but only X in the reference)

Version 0.1.1
	* Updated documentation

Version 0.1
	* Initial release
