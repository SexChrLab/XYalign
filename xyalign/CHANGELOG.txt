Development Version (currently branch called noY_support)
	* Output histograms of depth and mapq for each chromosome
	* Output full dataframes from bam analyses in addition to high/low bed files
	* Removed flags --high_quality_bed_out and --low_quality_bed_out (unused)
	* Fixed bug in which postprocessing bed files were overwriting preprocessing ones (with the same name)
	* Added STRIP_READS module to allow for read stripping outside of REMAPPING
	* Added option for --chromosomes ALL, to easily analyze all chromosomes
