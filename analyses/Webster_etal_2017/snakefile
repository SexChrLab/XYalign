This snakefile reproduces analyses from:

Webster et al., 2017. Inferring sex chromosome content and correcting for
technical biases in next-generation sequencing data.

It assumes the 1000 genomes fastqs from HG00512 and HG00513 are in the
directory called "fastqs", the 1000 genomes bam files from 24 individuals
are in the directory "processed_bams", and the fastqs from the gorillas
are in the directory "fastqs". See the README for more information about
these files.

It requires three reference genomes.
