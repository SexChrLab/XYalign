** Introduction ** 
Individuals who are chimeric for sex chromosome copy number variations may not know it, 
and due to the unique pattern of recombination on the sex chromosomes, individuals may 
have an atypical ploidy for only a region of the sex chromosomes, resulting in a subtle 
phenotype changes. Ploidy level will also affect estimates of genome diversity and variation 
that is required in most clinical genomic studies. Ploidy is important across the genome, 
and as genomic databases are increasing in size, it is becoming increasingly necessary to 
characterize ploidy variation across the genome, especially including the sex chromosomes 
for which anuploidy is common (e.g. 45,X occurs in 1/2500 while 47, XXY occurs in 1/1000 to 
1/500). There are simple and complex ways to infer ploidy, and nearly all of them are designed 
without thinking about the unique inheritance of the X and Y chromosome. Thus, we propose to 
develop tools to quickly infer ploidy in NGS data (DNA and RNA), focusing on the sex chromosomes, 
but which will be applicable across genomic regions. This tool (or tools) will also be useful 
for identifying sites that are heteroplasmic in mitochondrial DNA, and may be beneficial in 
studies outside of diploid organisms (e.g., cancer). These tools will be made open source.

* Table 1 * CALLABLE MASK
Poznik et al 2013 generate a mask for callable Y chromosome sequence.
   Here is the mask file for hg19: chrY.callable.hg19.bed.txt
   And I ran it through UCSC genome liftover tool to get the mask file for hg38: chrY.callable.hg38liftover.bed.txt
   We are also planning to make a new mask following the same rules for the hg38 reference sequence (instead of just a liftover).
