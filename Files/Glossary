PUR - Puerto Rican in Puerto Rico
PJL - Punjabi in Lahore, Pakistan
STU - Sri Lankan Tamil in the UK
TSI - Toscani in Italia
YRI - Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria
SVs - Structural Variants including inversions, translocations and copy number variants
CNVs - copy number variants in the form of deletions and duplications larger scale than indels (typically >1kb, can be as low as >50bp)
SNP - single nucleotide polymorphism
BWA - Burrows-Wheeler Aligner
SAM - Sequence Alignment/Map file used to represent aligned sequences
BAM - Binary Alignment/Map is the compressed binary version of a SAM file that is used to represent aligned sequences 
FASTQ  - format is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores
Reference genome - the 'true' genome for which the reads output from sequencing are aligned to
Allele frequency - relative frequency of an allele at a particular locus in a population. The fraction of all chromosomes in the population that carry that allele
SNV - single nucleotide variants
SNP - SNVs which are present in at least a given level within the population, typically 1%
Singleton/private SNV - single nucleotide variants that are only present in one individual in the population
VCF - Variant Call Format, text based file which describes the genetic variants
homozygous - all alleles at a given locus are the same allele
heterozygous - at a given locus, more than one allele is present. Typically 2 alleles in equal relative copy number 
PAR - psuedo autosomal region. Areas on the X and Y chromosomes with sequence homology where crossing over occurs, thus these sections of the sex chromosomes act like autosomal regions
XTR - X-transposed region. A locus on the Y chromosome where a section of the X chromosome has been inserted into the Y chromosome, following the human-chimpanzee divergence
Orphan reads - where only one read of a read pair is aligned to the reference genome
Ploidy - alterations in number of whole chromosomes within a cell/individual
Polyploidy - increases in the number of whole sets of chromosomes e.g. 3n
Aneuploidy - alterations in the number of single chromosomes e.g. 2n + 1

LASTZ - LASTZ is a program for aligning DNA sequences, a pairwise aligner. Used for self-self alignment of X and Y, and X vs. Y, which can identify areas of duplication and inversions within and between the chromosomes
BWA - Burrows-Wheeler Aligner, alignment tool
SAMtools - provide various utilities for manipulating alignments in the SAM format, including sorting, merging, indexing and generating alignments in a per-position format
python 2
1000 genome project - large project with sequencing of over 1000 human genomes with the goal of identifting all SNPs with frequencies >1%

Reference genome : GRCh38 with decoy dowloaded directly from 1000 genomes (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/GRCh38_reference_genome/)
Data: 1000 genomes - phase 3, YRI and CEU, 5 males and 5 females from each population
