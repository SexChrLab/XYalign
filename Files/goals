Goals of the Inferring Sex Chromosome Ploidy hackseq group: 

Infer total X chromosome and Y chromosome ploidy from WGS data

To do this: 
1. Assess proportion of heterozygous sites across the X chromosome and Y chromosome in XX and XY individuals.
2. Generate a mask of X and Y to be used for high quality ploidy estimate based on: 
   2.A. Depth
   2.B. Quality score
   2.C. 1-1 vs multiply aligning regions between X and Y (from lastZ)
3. Model expected distribution of alleles on X, Y and an autosome (chr19*).
   3.A. Look at distribution of peaks of read balance to infer proportion of X and Y
4. Generate a wrapper/script that will run on an X and Y extracted from a BAM file.

* Use chr 19 because it has a low rate of anueploidy and is a relatively small chromosome: http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(11)02810-X/fulltext
