Goals of the Inferring Sex Chromosome Ploidy hackseq group:

Infer total X chromosome and Y chromosome ploidy from WGS data

To do this:
1. Assess proportion of heterozygous sites across the X chromosome and Y chromosome in XX and XY individuals.
2. Generate a mask of X and Y to be used for high quality ploidy estimate based on:
   2.A. Depth
   2.B. Quality score
   2.C. 1-1 vs multiply aligning regions between X and Y (from lastZ)
3. Model expected distribution of alleles on X, Y and an autosome (chr19*).
   3.A. Look at distribution of peaks of read balance to infer proportion of X and Y
4. Generate a wrapper/script that will run on an X and Y extracted from a BAM file.

* Use chr 19 because it has a low rate of anueploidy and is a relatively small chromosome: http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(11)02810-X/fulltext

### List of Goals: Assess X/Y ploidy and correct for misalignment
1. Extract input chromosomes - recommend chrX, chrY, autosome (e.g., chr19) - from BAM

2. Infer sex chromosome ploidy from WGS data relative to autosomal ploidy
  + E.g., XX, XY, XXY, X0
  + And all other combinations

  Use
  + Quality
  + Read Depth
  + Allele Balance
  + Ampliconic/Palindromic/CNV filter

 Typical expectations for heterozygous calls under different sex chromosome complements:

  Genotype | X_call | Y_call
  --- | --- |  ---
  XX | het | none
  XY | hap | hap
  X0 | hap | none or partial_hap
  XXY | het or hap | hap
  XYY | hap | hap
  XXX | het | none

  Note: Half of 47,XXY are paternal in origin -> do not expect het sites: http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/4/309.full.pdf

  Expectations for depth under different sex chromosome complements:

  Genotype | X_depth | Y_depth
  --- | --- |  ---
  XX | 2x | 0x
  XY | 1x | 1x
  X0 | 1x | 0x (or partial)
  XXY | 2x | 1x
  XYY | 1x | 2x
  XXX | 3x | 0x


3. IF - If we infer there are no Y chromosomes in the sample, conduct re-mapping to increase confidence in X-linked alleles.
  + Strip reads from X and Y
  + Remap all X & Y reads to the X chromosome only
  + Remove X and Y from the input BAM file
  + Merge the empty Y and the remapped X chromosome into the BAM

4. IF - If we infer there are Y chromosomes in the sample, conduct re-mapping to increase confidence in X-linked alleles.
  + Strip reads from X and Y
  + Remap all X & Y reads to the X chromosome, and the accompanying Y chromosmoe with PARs masked out.
  + Remove X and Y from the input BAM file
  + Merge the empty Y and the remapped X chromosome into the BAM

5. Assessment:
  + Variant calling in 1000 genomes high coverage data before/after XYalign
  + Test how different alignment algorithms, parameters, and reference sequences affect X & Y variant calling
  + Compare variant calling with the "Gold Standard" reference individual
  + Assess XYalign on simulated sex chromosome aneuploidy data

Other goals: Because I think we have to address this if we want to get a really good handle on #2 given the extremely high copy number variable regions on X and Y - the ampliconic regions. Likely we will masking them out to infer #2, which will be easiest, but then we can have an extended goal to see characterize variations in these regions.
